Today marks my last day as a software application developer at Service Express. I am excited to announce that I will be starting a new role as a software developer II at [Campspot](https://www.campspot.com). 

I have spent the last 4 years working at Service Express; a year as an intern and three years as a full-time developer. It is bittersweet to be moving on, but I am excited for the new opportunities to come! 

Over my years at Service Express, I have grown a immensely on both a personal and professional level. I have had the opportunity to develop projects from the ground up on my own, learn tons of new skills and best practices, and become a mentor. 

I have had the pleasure to work with great developers, leads, and managers who I have created lasting friendships with. I owe a lot of my personal success to these people. Many of them have worked with me since I was just starting out as an intern. Through their patience, understanding, and guidance I have been able to grow to where I am now. 

Service Express will always hold a special place in me as my first full-time employer. I am eternally grateful for all of the opportunities I have been given here. It has been exciting seeing all the progress that has taken place here over the last 4 years. 

With that said, here is to my journey with Campspot! I am eager to dive in and expand my knowledge with new technologies and practices.
