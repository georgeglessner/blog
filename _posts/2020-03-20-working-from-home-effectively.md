I have been working from home full time for over a year now since I have moved to Arizona. Working from home is nothing new to me at this point, but it is new to a lot of people who are being urged to work from home at this time. I wanted to share a few tips I have learned over the last year of working from home to help keep you productive and motivated.


## Video Conferencing is Key
Video conferencing is a great way to conduct remote meetings. Try to use video whenever possible to show engagement and make the meeting more personal. Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams are a few good applications to conduct video calls. 

## Communicate with Your Team 
Communication is key for a successful team. Working remotely does not need to limit the amount of communication we have with our team members. Utilizing messaging apps such as Telegram and Microsoft teams is a great way to stay in contact with your teammates while working from home.

## Take Breaks 
Contrary to popular belief, working from home can actually be less distracting than working in the office, and you can lose track of time more easily. It is important to be mindful of how long you have been sitting in front of your computer and take a short 5-10 minute break every hour or so. Go for a walk, get a snack, anything that doesn't involve looking at a screen. 

## Keep Your Calendar Up-to-Date
Working from home, your team will be less informed on when you are available to have meetings. Keeping your calendar up-to-date is an easy way to let your teammates know when you are available for a video call.

## Have a Dedicated Workspace
Having a dedicated space to do you work will limit your distractions. Whether it be an actual office in your house or just a desk, knowing that space is used for work will help you get in the right mindset to work from home. If you don't have an extra room or a desk at home to work, try to set up your workspace anywhere but the couch, for obvious reasons. 


I realize that working from home can be a big shift for some, I experienced the shift when I moved. The mentioned tips have helped my transition to working from home full time a much easier process, and I hope they will help you out as well!
