Welcome to my blog! My goal for this blog is to share any tips or experiences I have pertaining to software development, fishing, or anything else I find interesting. This blog is not intended to be formal, it is inteded to be a medium for me to share my thoughts with others. Blogging is new and intimidating for me, so bear with me!
